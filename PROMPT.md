# INITIAL PROMPT

I am a student who is learning to code both from scratch and with AI. I have no coding experience at all. I want to build the following, and learn how it works:

### BEGIN Describe the idea here
- Is a game like tic-tac-toe, but for four players
- Has a 5x5 tile grid instead of 3x3
- Uses the same rules as tic-tac-toe to win--a player has to get three in a row diagonally, vertically, or horizontally, can only put their piece in an available tile, and takes turns
- If there are not enough human players, then the computer controls the other players
- The computer will try to win by getting three in a row, but first tries to block other players from winning
- Has a fun animation when someone wins
- Has a different animation if all tiles are full and no one has one (everyone loses)
- Has fun animations every time someone plays
- Is a web site I can put on the Internet
### END Describe the idea here

Before making anything, create a detailed plan. Think hard about this. If there are any details I missed in my request which you need to know, please ask me before you make your plan. Evaluate your plan and make sure it will work correctly right away. Once you are satisfied with your plan, break the plan down into the tiny steps you will execute. For each step, create a document named "STEP #: TITLE", where # is the step number and TITLE is a one-to-three word description of what the step is doing. Each step should stop at a place where the web site runs successfully, even if it is incomplete. In each of these documents, explain exactly what you will do in each step, and why. Provide instructions for me to execute the same step myself. Once the project is complete and running, go back through these documents and update them to reflect any changes you may have made.

Create your project in a subdirectory named "example". Create another folder called "student". I will start making the project myself in the "student" folder, one step at a time. As I finish each step, I will ask you to compare what I did in my step with what you did in yours. Keep this in mind when creating the project and your instruction documents. For the final step, recommend where and how I can put this on the Internet at a custom domain name.

Use industry standard technology to create the project, so that when I learn to make this, I will have valuable knowledge I can use to get a job.

### The agent will ask clarifying questions

# PROMPT FOR THE COMPLETION OF EACH STEP

I have completed step # in the "student" folder. Using the "Step #" document, compare the work I did with what is in example, and rate how I did. If I made any mistakes, please help me understand how to fix them. Is what I did working and good enough to continue to the next step, or should I go back and fix anything?
