# Four Player Tic-Tac-Toe - Learning Project

Welcome to your coding journey! This project will teach you web development by building a fun, retro-styled game from scratch.

## 🎮 What You're Building

A browser-based tic-tac-toe game with:
- **4 players** competing on a **5x5 grid**
- **3-in-a-row wins** (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- **Smart AI opponents** that block and try to win
- **Retro 80s arcade aesthetic** with animations and sounds
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive design

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Complete Beginners:

1. **Open the `STEP 1: Setup.md` file** - This has everything you need to start
2. **Follow each step carefully** - Read the explanations
3. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy/paste (you'll learn more!)
4. **Test after each step** - Make sure it works before moving on
5. **Compare with my example/** folder if you get stuck

### How to Work Through This:

Each step file includes:
- **What you're building** in that step
- **Why it matters** (learning concepts)
- **Step-by-step instructions** for you to follow
- **Code explanations** so you understand what each line does
- **Success criteria** to know you're done
- **Troubleshooting tips** for common issues

### Two Folders Approach:

- **`example/`** - My completed code. Use this as reference when stuck.
- **`student/`** - Your workspace. Build the game here following the step guides.

When you finish a step, you can compare your code with mine to see different approaches!

3. **STEP 3: Board** - Create 5x5 game grid
4. **STEP 4: Turn Logic** - Implement player turns
5. **STEP 5: Win Detection** - Check for 3-in-a-row
6. **STEP 6: AI Basic** - Add random AI moves
7. **STEP 7: AI Smart** - Make AI block and attack
8. **STEP 8: Animations** - Add retro visual effects
9. **STEP 9: Win Celebration** - Win/tie animations
10. **STEP 10: Sounds** - Add retro sound effects
11. **STEP 11: Polish** - Mobile support & cleanup
12. **STEP 12: Deployment** - Put it on the internet!

**Time estimate:** 8-15 hours total (1-2 hours per step)

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's:
✅ Read the explanations - don't just copy code
✅ Type code manually - builds muscle memory
✅ Test after each change - catch errors early
✅ Use the browser console (F12) - see what's happening
✅ Take breaks - learning is a marathon, not a sprint
✅ Ask questions - confusion is part of learning!

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't skip steps - they build on each other
❌ Don't copy/paste without understanding
❌ Don't worry about making it perfect
❌ Don't compare your progress to others
❌ Don't give up when stuck - debugging is normal!

## 🔧 Tools You'll Need

### Required:
- **Web Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- **Text Editor** - VS Code (recommended), Sublime Text, or even Notepad

### Optional but Helpful:
- **VS Code Extensions:**
  - Live Server (preview in real-time)
  - Prettier (code formatting)
  - HTML CSS Support

## 🐛 Getting Help

### If you're stuck:

1. **Check the browser console** (F12 key)
   - Red text = errors
   - Read the error message carefully

2. **Compare with my `example/` folder**
   - See how I did it
   - Note: there are multiple right ways!

3. **Re-read the step instructions**
   - The answer is usually there

4. **Google the error message**
   - Millions of developers have been stuck too!

5. **Take a break and come back**
   - Fresh eyes solve problems

## 🎓 After You Finish

### Show Off Your Work:
- Deploy to GitHub Pages (Step 12)
- Share on LinkedIn
- Add to your portfolio
- Show friends and family!

### What's Next:
- Build another project (todo app, calculator, etc.)
- Learn React or Vue.js
- Study computer science fundamentals
- Contribute to open source
- Apply for junior developer positions!

### Your Completed Project Proves:
✅ You can build working software
✅ You understand web fundamentals
✅ You can solve complex problems
✅ You can learn independently
✅ You're ready for more advanced topics!

## 📝 Comparing Your Work with Mine

After each step:

1. Test your version - make sure it works
2. Open my `example/` folder
3. Compare the code
4. Note differences - both versions might be correct!
5. Understand why I made certain choices

**Remember:** There's rarely one "right" way to code something!
